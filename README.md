# CommonCrawl Downloader

## Purpose

[CommonCrawl](https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/get-started/) is a nonprofit organization that crawls the web and freely
provides its archives and datasets to the public. The Common Crawl corpus contains petabytes of data collected since
2013. It contains monthly updates of raw web page data that are hosted as WARC files on Amazon Web Services' (AWS) S3
storage servers located in the US-East-1 (Northern Virginia) AWS Region.

This script was written with the purpose of downloading and processing the raw web page data for a user-provided list of
domain names (e.g. apple.com, walmart.com, microsoft.com). We first get the byte range within the WARC file where a
specific subpage is stored by querying the CommonCrawl Index via Athena. Using the byte range, the raw html of a webpage
is downloaded and parsed into clear text. Then all passages around mentions of a user-provided list of keywords are
extracted. The passages, along with information about their source are uploaded in batches of csv files to S3. The
output files can then be downloaded or further processed. The output files have the following format:

By using Fargate spot instances the processing is cheap (in case a task is interrupted, it is just re-attempted). Also
transfer speed is maximal because we access the CommonCrawl data from the same AWS region where it is hosted.

## How to run

### AWS Permissions & Authentication

To run the script, you first need to make an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/). You then need
to [create](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home) an IAM-User in the US-East-1 region and add the
following permissions:

- AmazonAthenaFullAccess
- AWSBatchFullAccess
- IAMFullAccess
- AmazonS3FullAccess

After you created the user and added all permission, click on > Security credentials > create access key > Download .csv
file:

Provide the path to the credential file that you just downloaded under config.yml > credentials_csv_filepath.

You also need to [create](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/roles) a role and add the following
permissions:

- AmazonS3FullAccess
- CloudWatchFullAccess
- AmazonAthenaFullAccess
- AmazonElasticContainerRegistryPublicReadOnly

Once you created the role and added all permissions, click on the role and click the copy symbol next to the role's ARN:

Provide the role's ARN that you just copied under config.yml > credentials_csv_filepath.

### Creating a bucket for the project

Navigate to the [S3 console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets?region=us-east-1) and create a bucket for your
project in the US-East-1 region. The bucket can be private or public.

### Uploading URL list

In the bucket you created, create a folder and in it, upload the list of domain names that you are interested in as a
csv file. *Warning:* URLs should not contain "https" or "www." upfront, just the domain name (e.g. apple.com). Provide
the full S3 path of the *folder* (not the file itself), e.g. 's3://cc-extract/url_list/', under config.yml >
s3path_url_list.

### Choosing which subpages to download for each domain

There are often many hundred subpages per domain and downloading and processing all of them might be too costly. You
have two ways of selecting a subset of subpages per domain:

- Downloading the n_subpages subpages with the shortest URLs. For instance, if n_subpages is 2 and the crawled subpages
  have the URLs 'apple.com/store', 'apple.com/contact', and 'apple.com/iphone-14/switch/, only 'apple.com/store' and '
  apple.com/contact' will be downloaded and processed.
- Selecting subpages that contain at least one of a list of keywords in their website address. For example, if "covid"
  is in the url_keywords list, the subpage with the URL:'apple.com/covid-19' will be downloaded. However, you might
  still get too many subpages containing such keywords, in which case you can limit the number of such subpages to
  download per domain by specifying the config.yml > limit_pages_url_keywords parameter. You can use both ways of
  filtering, just one, or neither (by setting the n_subpages and url_keywords_path parameters to None).

### Providing keyword and URL keyword lists

Your keyword lists (what will be searched for in the actual body of a webpage) and URL keyword lists (what will be
searched for in the subpage URLs) need to be accessible to the containers spawned by AWS Batch. You can upload them as
csv files to the S3 bucket you created and provide their full S3 path as parameters in config.yml > keywords_path and
url_keywords_path. You could also upload them somewhere else, e.g. a public Github repo. Again, all input files should
be csv.

### Choosing a time frame (which crawls are searched)

[This](https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/get-started/) is a list of all available crawls on CommonCrawl. Using this
downloader you can acess all crawls in WARC format, i.e. anything after and including the CC-MAIN-2013-20 crawl (the
format is CRAWL-NAME-YYYY-WW – The name of the crawl and year + week it was initiated). You can specify one or multiple
crawls you want to search under config.yml > crawls. *Warning:* Searching many crawls can quickly lead to considerable
costs, see estimated costs.

### Estimated costs
The costs of querying Athena for each crawl you want to search are somewhat fixed, that is, they will be around 0.30$-0.50$ per
crawl, independent of the number of URLs you provide.

The costs of downloading and processing the raw webpages depend on the number of URLs you provide and the
number of subpages you want to download for each URL. The costs are estimated as follows: 
1307960 subpages cost
